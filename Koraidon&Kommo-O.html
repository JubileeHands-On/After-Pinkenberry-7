Misty@laughing : "then Ash was so nonchalant about all that he threw off from his personal life except for Combu rest either themselves went or he threw off but Combu and her Shrew being the only ones who have had a prolonged association with him because Shrew is so outlandishly patient intrictrinsically and Combu literally treating her big bro as she herself, they kept contacts by themselves just enough to keep a tab on my bee..and me via their contacts that is Irie#..anyhow it was till Ash accused May of delusion with particularity and so on which really did break her heart Drew said she like cried for 3 days and so on Ash was only disappointed about as he told me but then he said still that ensured you had one more supporter and me left with only two who i knew would be so as long as my professional life goes..personally i never needed support you know why Gary agreed to it day 1#..
anyhow Serrie was to receive as much love as May she just wasn't stable enough mentally at that point to realise it and was so badly tormented afterwards so she recently met me and was crying like nothing i said i was in similar situation to you so many times it's a matter of fact that's all#..said no..not that but when out of deep voidenss i stormed out to..Unovan Contests and met Kommo-O..with a Spinda#..i realised everything only after this but i having a research oriented background wanted to meet bro's Kimmie via Clem if possible i said else i told him to tell me about my queries as much as he knows cause he by then knew everyone too well via backchannels introduced to him by bro himself#..by the way,Bonnie didn't pay any attention to our situation at all saying no I don't get it a thing happens and then something happens out of it but so what?..if i am then i am me thus something will be my and something not so which will be in an equilibrium but i will still be me what's so surprising in a decision making process?#..so i realised such completely headless pests are certainly such great food for those dark menaces#..now Clem was a bit worried said um..no it um..,i said means you can't control them and you're an electric trainer..so called..HoF#..said fair enough but you need to sort out your relationship with Bazu first else you can't handle it#..so i didn't bother but then just before calling bro Bazu said it's better to be prepared unlike the first time something i never forgot you see#..so i straightaway contacted Dr Oak to give me permission to come to the lab i already secured the job anyhow he knew it too well#..we didn't know anything about it because it's the remotest wing from ours#..anyhow says i went in and Dr Skechit personally took me there#..i meet Kimmie and Korrie#..
many days havin' past..if time could recall self/oh bein' why you still tryin' to be your-self/seein' you detached and pure of..My case/oh usin' self as Ms Serena why you seem happy to be..at just your very Best?..
I instantly went into Dr Skechit said some kind of 8 typed 43 subtyped 6 units of coma#..only to be pestered out by the many of the brats who poked my mind in many a ways having been unable to stretch their feathers on me for quite a while#..i said yeah i understood you really are too sweet for this profession#..Ash said later well after the situation Lati and Liti shrugged me off saying..
scratchin' crawlin' toilin' fumblin' still goin' through doubt's woods/oh compeer alas you found what you thought your MOODS/thus entails from a start that started from somethin' else/in infite illusion ends why compeer..MY Little Case?..
Ash said i accused them of spreading unfaithfulness#..Through The Glasses of Daily Freedom of Anchor,#,..
